***If you are going to crete a server***

1. npm init
    Through this you can create a default structure for your server but you need to create first index.js or server.js.
    You can see you have a node_modeules, packages.json and package-lock.json files, if you dont get these files so need to run npm i 

2. now you need to instal different packages acording to your app just for an example : express, body-parser, fs, morgan, nodemon, dotenv
    (to get this files run package name with npm install: npm i dotenv)
