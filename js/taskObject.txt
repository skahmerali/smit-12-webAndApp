Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to create a complex data structure for an online store. You will design a system that manages products, customers, orders, and categories. This assignment will test your understanding of arrays, objects, and how they can be nested inside each other.

Instructions:
Define an Online Store Object: Create a JavaScript object that represents an online store. This object should contain several key pieces of information:

The store’s name (e.g., "TechWorld Online Store").
The store’s location (e.g., "New York, NY").
A list of categories available in the store (e.g., "Laptops", "Smartphones", "Accessories").
A list of products available in the store, where each product has:
id: A unique identifier for the product.
name: The name of the product (e.g., "MacBook Pro").
category: The category this product belongs to (e.g., "Laptops").
price: The price of the product.
stock: The number of units available.
Details: An object with additional information about the product (e.g., brand, model, color, screen size).
Customer Information: The store should also maintain information about its customers. Each customer object should have:

id: A unique identifier for the customer.
firstName: The customer's first name.
lastName: The customer's last name.
email: The customer's email address.
phoneNumber: The customer's phone number.
Address: An object that contains the customer's address, including street, city, state, and zip code.
Orders: An array of orders made by the customer. Each order object should include:
orderId: A unique identifier for the order.
date: The date the order was placed.
status: The current status of the order (e.g., "Shipped", "Delivered", "Processing").
totalAmount: The total cost of the order.
Products: An array of products in the order, where each product has:
productId: The ID of the product being ordered.
quantity: The number of units ordered.
price: The price of the product at the time of the order.
Example Data: Based on the structure described above, create example data for the following:

At least 3 products in the store (you can choose any products like laptops, phones, or accessories).
At least 2 categories (such as "Laptops" and "Smartphones").
At least 2 customers, each with at least 2 orders.
Tasks: Once you have created your object structure, you will need to:

Task 1: Calculate the Total Value of an Order Write a description (not code) for how to calculate the total value of a customer's order by summing the price of each product multiplied by its quantity.

Task 2: Update Product Stock Describe how the stock of a product should be updated when an order is placed. For example, if a customer buys 2 units of a product, the stock should decrease by 2.

Task 3: Get All Products in a Category Describe how to retrieve all products that belong to a specific category (e.g., "Laptops"). What information do you need to filter through?

Task 4: Get All Orders for a Customer Write a description of how to retrieve all orders placed by a particular customer. Include how to show the products in each order, along with the quantity and total price.

Deliverables:
A detailed data structure (JavaScript object) that represents the store, categories, products, and customers.
Short descriptions or pseudocode of how to solve the tasks listed above (e.g., calculations, updating stock, filtering categories, etc.).
